        <h1>About</h1>

        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>
          This is the same application I previousely build but now with
          Typescript
        </p>
        <p>
          This application aims to provide weather information for first-time
          travelers to Japan. Where it aims to provide weather information for a
          few key cities namely: Tokyo, Yokohama, Kyoto, Osaka, Sapporo, Nagoya.
        </p>
        <h2>Information used technologies</h2>
        <p>
          This application has been build using, but not limited too, Vue (Vue
          CLI), HTML, CSS (SASS) and JavaScript with Yarn as a packagemanager
          and using ESlint as a lint checker.
        </p>
        <h2>Dependencies</h2>
        <p>
          Main dependencies include, among ohter, Vuex, Vue router, Axios,
          FontAwesome, sass and moment.js
        </p>
        <h2>Design/UI/UX choices</h2>
        <p>
          This application aims to provide information quickly and orderly.
          <br />
          It's set up so that the user can flow through the page from top to
          bottom with different sections that intend to give the user different
          information <br />
          We start out with a current location section. This section has been
          added so that a potential traveler already in Japan can see what the
          weather is like and adjust his itinerary for the day accordingly.
          <br />
          <br />

          The next section shows the 6 popular destinations inside Japan and the
          current weather for those locations. Only basic information is shown
          and everything is clean and legible. If a user clicks the block the
          sections with the 5-day forecast are shown and the user scrolls to
          that. <br />
          The same block layout, excluding the icons, is used here to give the
          user a brief overview of the 5-day forecast. <br />
          <br />

          For users wishing to visit another city not listed, they can search
          for any city they want with the search field. Once searched the
          current information for that city will be shown like the above
          sections.<br />
          <br />

          The UI flow from top to bottom has been implemented to lead the user
          through the application and make it easy for him to use the
          application and find the information he needs. <br /><br />

          Since this is an international application the user has the option to
          switch from Celcius to Fahrenheit and back. <br />
          <br />

          Not all the information is displayed immediately since it might not be
          of use for every user but it:s easily and readily available when the
          user clicks the blocks or buttons.<br />
          <br />

          The design is being kept simple and flat so that everything easily is
          seen and the right information can be found fast and to keep
          everything legible. <br />
          Colors are being used to accent important information and icons are
          being used to point the user to important parts of the applications
          while giving him visual information about the weather as well. <br />

          All buttons are being displayed in a conventional way and are easily
          identifiable as buttons. Block with links have visual indicators and
          hover effects to indicate they do something when the user clicks them.
          <br /><br />

          Basically everything should be
          <strong
            >to the point, easily identifable, easy to use/understand and
            legiable</strong
          >.
